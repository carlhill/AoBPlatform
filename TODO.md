# To-do

Things agreed but not built. Not a backlog of ideas — everything here has been
decided, and is written down so it does not get re-decided.

Convention: each entry says what it is, WHY it was deferred rather than done,
and what it depends on. An entry with no "why deferred" is just an unfinished
task and belongs in the code as a TODO comment instead.

## Onboarding

### AI chat bot for application status
**Status:** not started.
**Decided:** 2026-08-22, Carl.

An applicant waiting on a decision should be able to ask "where is my
application" without ringing anyone. The acknowledgement email will offer three
routes — call us, check the status page, or ask the bot — and the third does not
exist yet.

**Why deferred:** the status page has to exist before a bot has anything to
answer from, and the bot's scope needs a boundary drawn before it is built. It
must be able to say what stage an application is at and what is outstanding. It
must NOT be able to say why a reviewer is hesitating, disclose whether an ABN is
already registered here (that turns a status query into a way to enumerate
customers — the same rule already enforced on rejection reasons), or give any
impression of deciding. A bot that sounds like it is approving something is
worse than no bot.

**Depends on:** the public status page.

### Public application-status page
**Status:** not started.
**Decided:** 2026-08-22, Carl.

`/status/<token>` — the same three-row gate ledger the applicant saw when they
submitted, showing where the application has got to.

**Why deferred:** needs a bearer token that is NOT the practice id. The id is a
primary key: it ends up in logs, referrer headers and support tickets, and a
primary key that doubles as a credential is a credential that leaks. A separate
random token, revocable independently, is a column and a migration.

**Depends on:** nothing else.

## Identity

### The two identity-strength dashboards
**Status:** designed, not built. See IDENTITY-STRENGTH-DESIGN.md.

Practice identity strength and practitioner identity strength, each filterable
by practitioner name and practice.

**Why deferred:** scoring is captured and stored already; the dashboards are a
reporting surface over data that is accumulating correctly in the meantime, so
delay costs nothing.

## Open questions

These block work and need Carl, not code.

- **REVIEW-REQUIRED.md** — two files still marked DRAFT, awaiting sign-off.
- **PIE licence** — $4,000 API install + $1,000/yr + $1/practitioner/yr. Alert
  is browser-only, so it cannot be automated. Decision needed before the
  entitlement check can be anything other than a phone call.
- **CLAUDE.md §7 sign-off** — fetching an applicant's website, and sending mail
  from a real domain, both need explicit approval before they leave the sandbox.
- **Collection notice** — not written. Required before any real applicant data
  is collected.
- **Retention conflict** — 7-year practitioner report vs 2-year stated
  retention. These cannot both be true; one has to give.
- **Can a sole trader reach 6 points?** If not, the identity threshold quietly
  excludes them, which is a policy decision and not a scoring detail.
